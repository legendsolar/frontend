    aboutSevenYearTerm: `After seven years have passed, the power off-taker where your panels are located will repurchase the panels at the greater of either an appraised value or a negotiated amount, as specified in the purchase agreement. This repurchase will conclude your investment term. You will be unable to sell your panels in advance of the term without potentially risking an IRS clawback of MACRS depreciation benefits.`,
    aboutInvestmentTaxCredit: `This investment qualifies for the investment tax credit. That means you will be eligible to access cash benefits equal to 26% of the total cost of this investment. In addition, you will be eligible to access accelerated MACRS depreciation benefits available for certain investments in renewable energy. Details on these benefits are in the Pro Forma.`,
    aboutRooftopMonitoring: `Your solar panels generate data on how much electricity they produce – we use Rooftop to make that data accessible to you. This information is put in context with your carbon impact and earnings, so you’ll always know what positive effect your investment is having in the world and how you are benefiting from it.`,
    aboutWorkmanshipWarrenty: `The contractor who installed this solar facility provided a workmanship warranty which will last for the full duration of the investment term. This warranty covers issues related to manufacturer defects and the quality of the installation. It does not include damage caused by other events like natural disasters. `,
