# Custom Hook Libary 

Almost all of the custom logic and funcionality needed for Legends is included here. 

Most are relatively self contained and generalized, but a few are purpose built for certain applications. `use_reservations`, for example is specifically designed for the new Legends public site.

Likely, some components, like the user-input associated ones, could be greatly simplified with a custom hook, but I haven't had the time to refactor them into one.
