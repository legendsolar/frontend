# Hasura 

This workspace includes all metadata for a Docker-based Hasura and Postgres instance to run for local testing. 

All metadata in `hasura/metadata` is automatically pushed to the live Hasura instance on commits, so direct modifications to the live instance should not be made. This will only be overwritten on the next push.
